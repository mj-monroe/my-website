  <h2>How It All Began</h2>
    <p>In the beginning, internet humor was simple jokes, limited by what could be expressed on the keyboard. Throughout the years, images were thrown into the mix and thus 
      was born: the meme. Memes began as fummy images with relatable text such as: </p>

  <h2>Memes of the Early 2000s</h2>
    <p>In the early 2000s, memes became a widespread form of internet humor. Moms and teens alike were posting and viewing them on Facebook (The only large social media platform
      at the time). The formula for a perfect meme comprised of a funny image with a bold white text that referenced something everyone could understand. There were also the 
      classic meme faces that were seen just about everywhere</p>

  <h2>Memes of the Modern Day</h2>
    <p>Once Gen Z kids got their hands on memes, they began to make a shift from relatable middle aged humor to younger, more teen-relevant topics. Common topics
      to be found in memes include minecraft, Barak Obama, dark humor, and plenty of other miscellaneous things. More often than not, these memes have no real meaning 
      and are funny to younger generations for reasons yet to be discovered. Here are some examples:</p>

  <h2>Abstract and Deep Fried Memes</h2>
    <p>There is an even more evolved type of meme that either makes absolutely no sense at all; or, if you have a very dank and abstract sense of humor, it's very 
      amusing. Deep fried memes have been altered to make the photo quality very poor. they also have laser beams and bright green colors to add a visually apalling 
      effect. Quite frankly, modern memes are a marvel and I wonder what people will make of them when they look back in 100 years. However for now, here are some 
      examples of abstract memes:</p>
